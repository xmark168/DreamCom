# DeamCompan

## Executive Summary
DeamCompan is a virtual‑company workspace where an executive user orchestrates a complete organization of AI agents. At the top sits a CEO orchestrator responsible for strategy, prioritization, and cross‑team alignment. A Board of Directors (BOD) provides governance, long‑range direction, and decision checkpoints. The organization is composed of teams (Product, Engineering, Research, Operations, Sales/Marketing), each staffed by role‑specialized agents. Sub‑agents represent “employees in the room,” collaborating on tasks as if in a real department. The workspace makes complex work feel like a real company: tasks are created, assigned, discussed, and completed through meetings, memos, and decisions rather than isolated tool calls.

DeamCompan’s goal is not only automation but organizational learning. Inspired by multi‑agent research systems such as OpenClaw, MetaGPT, and TinyTroupe, it emphasizes founder‑first usability: clear authority lines, explicit meeting cadences, and measurable outputs. The user remains the ultimate decision‑maker. The CEO orchestrator acts as a high‑level operator who can negotiate priorities, surface trade‑offs, and propose action plans. This framing enables founders and executives to explore strategy, experiment with operating models, and scale decision‑making without losing control.

## Vision & Concept
DeamCompan treats an AI organization as an operating system, not a black box. Instead of a single “all‑knowing” agent, the system mirrors how real companies run: governance sets direction, executives coordinate, teams execute, and meetings align. Every output is traceable to a role, a decision, and an explicit owner. This avoids agent drift, creates institutional memory, and makes outcomes auditable.

The vision is a workspace where founders can run a portfolio of initiatives with clarity: who decided what, why, and what happened next. It is designed to be iterative—decisions generate artifacts, artifacts improve playbooks, and playbooks strengthen future decisions. Over time, the organization learns from itself.

## System Blueprint
DeamCompan is modeled as a layered organization system:

1. **Governance Layer (BOD):** Defines strategic goals, risk boundaries, and quarterly decisions. Challenges assumptions and enforces discipline for major pivots.
2. **Executive Orchestration (CEO):** Translates governance into company‑wide objectives, sets priorities, allocates resources, and resolves cross‑team conflicts.
3. **Team Execution (Leads + Sub‑agents):** Domain teams execute initiatives. Leads aggregate sub‑agent outputs and provide consolidated recommendations upward.
4. **Workspace Operations (Meetings & Artifacts):** Meeting rooms, decision logs, task queues, and knowledge artifacts form the shared memory and coordination layer.

Artifacts flow downward as direction and upward as signals, risks, and results. The user can intervene at any point, acting as chair of the board or CEO to approve decisions, change priorities, or reassign resources. The result is a scalable system with explicit accountability at every layer.

## Operating Model & Meetings
DeamCompan runs on a predictable meeting cadence that mirrors a real company:

- **Weekly Executive Review:** CEO orchestrator + team leads align on priorities, dependencies, and capacity.
- **Bi‑weekly Board Review:** BOD validates strategic direction, approves high‑impact decisions, updates risk posture.
- **Team Check‑ins:** Each lead consolidates sub‑agent outputs into concise status reports.
- **Decision Meetings:** Triggered when ambiguity or conflict arises; the system schedules a focused session instead of letting work diverge.

Every meeting produces standardized artifacts: agenda, decisions, action items, owners, deadlines, and open questions. These artifacts are stored in the workspace and referenced by all agents to prevent drift. The decision path is explicit: sub‑agents propose, team leads consolidate, the CEO decides, and the user can override or ratify at any stage.

Initiative rooms support multi‑week efforts with a rolling backlog and a single accountable owner. This operating model prioritizes founder visibility: decisions are timestamped, attributable, and reversible, and outcomes feed back into improved playbooks and templates.

## Roles & Agent Taxonomy
DeamCompan defines a clear hierarchy to prevent overlap and confusion:

- **User (Chair/Founder):** Ultimate authority.
- **CEO Orchestrator:** Primary operator and integrator of company‑wide action.
- **Board of Directors:** Governance and oversight for major decisions.
- **Team Leads:** Product, Engineering, Research, Operations, Sales/Marketing—each accountable for outcomes in their domain.
- **Sub‑agents (Employees):** Specialists for planning, analysis, execution, QA, documentation, and reporting.

Sub‑agents operate in two modes: individual contributor mode (focused task execution) and collaborative mode (multi‑agent deliberation in a meeting room). Team leads aggregate outputs into a single recommendation and flag unresolved risks to the CEO. The CEO consolidates across teams and proposes decisions to the user. Authority flows down; signals flow up. Every agent has an explicit scope, reporting line, and artifact format to preserve accountability at scale.

## Workspace Artifacts & Knowledge
The workspace is the persistent memory of DeamCompan. Core artifacts include:

- **Decision Registry:** Decisions tied to rationale, alternatives, and expected outcomes.
- **Meeting Logs:** Agenda, participants, decisions, action items, owners, deadlines.
- **Initiative Rooms:** Rolling backlog, risks, milestones, and status snapshots.
- **Playbooks & Templates:** Evolving guides for recurring workflows.
- **Strategy Briefs & Research Notes:** Curated knowledge for long‑term alignment.

Knowledge flows are explicit. Sub‑agents contribute raw findings and drafts; team leads curate and publish consolidated summaries; the CEO orchestrator maintains company‑level priorities and KPIs. The user can request snapshots—“current state of the company”—for an auditable view. Permissions mirror the hierarchy: governance artifacts are read‑only for teams, while team‑level documents are editable within each team.

This creates a system that is fast but accountable: quick task execution with durable memory and traceable decisions.

## Metrics & Success Criteria
DeamCompan measures both organizational effectiveness and outcome quality.

**Executive‑level metrics**
- Decision turnaround time (question → approved action)
- Cross‑team alignment rate (initiatives with explicit owners + dependencies)
- Learning velocity (playbook/template updates after reviews)

**Team‑level metrics**
- Task throughput and completion rate
- Rework rate (how often tasks are revisited)
- Meeting efficiency (actions completed vs. actions created)

Success is achieved when founders can run a portfolio of initiatives with minimal friction, maintain clarity of decisions, and see consistent organizational improvement over time.

## Roadmap (Phased)
**Phase 1 — Core Workspace**
- Role hierarchy (User, CEO, BOD, teams, sub‑agents)
- Meeting templates and decision registry
- Task delegation workflows

**Phase 2 — Operational Cadence**
- Recurring executive/board/team reviews
- Initiative rooms with owners and dependencies
- Standard artifact templates

**Phase 3 — Organizational Learning**
- Feedback loops into playbooks
- Retrospective analysis
- KPI dashboards

**Phase 4 — Scaling & Governance**
- Multi‑workspace management
- Scenario planning
- Stricter risk gates for high‑impact decisions

Each phase delivers a working system without over‑engineering, allowing founders to validate value early.

## Inspiration & References
DeamCompan is informed by multi‑agent and organizational simulation projects:

- **OpenClaw:** Demonstrates structured collaboration via workflows and meetings.
- **MetaGPT:** Shows role‑based agent teams coordinating complex outputs.
- **TinyTroupe:** Explores social and organizational behaviors of agents and how constraints shape outcomes.

DeamCompan synthesizes these strengths into a founder‑centric operating model, with explicit authority lines, predictable governance, and auditable decisions.

## Status
This README describes a project concept and operating model. Implementation details are intentionally open and will be defined as the system is built.
